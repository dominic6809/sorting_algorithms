# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description
This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C, along with explanations of their Big O complexities. The goal of this project is to provide a practical understanding of how different sorting algorithms work and their efficiency in terms of time complexity.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort

## Files
- `0-bubble_sort.c`: Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `1-insertion_sort_list.c`: Implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm for linked lists.
- `2-selection_sort.c`: Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
- `3-quick_sort.c`: Implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm.
- `4-merge_sort.c`: Implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm.

## How to Use
To use these sorting algorithms, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the sorting algorithm you want to use.
3. Compile the C file using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
4. Run the compiled executable, providing the input data as required.

Example:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort
./bubble_sort

```

## Big O Notation

1. Bubble Sort: O(n^2)
2. Insertion Sort: O(n^2)
3. Selection Sort: O(n^2)
4. Quick Sort: O(n log n) average, O(n^2) worst case
5. Merge Sort: O(n log n)

## Credits
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum, and the sorting algorithm implementations are based on the teachings and resources provided by the school.
